1. Questions & Answers
A. How long do they run and what’s the battery made of? Is it in the frame?

    Battery Type: Lithium Polymer (LiPo) or advanced solid-state microbattery.
    Placement: Two slim batteries, one in each arm of the frame, close to the hinge (temple area).
    Single Battery Life: ~4-6 hours continuous thermal mode; ~10+ hours regular mode.
    Dual System: ~8-12 hours thermal mode (both batteries active).
    Charge Time: ~1-1.5 hours (fast USB-C charging per side).
    Biohazard Safety: Batteries are sealed, low-heat emission, and encased in non-conductive, heat-resistant material.

B. What’s the frame made of (element-wise)? Is it durable?

    Core: Aircraft-grade titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, elements: Ti, Al, V) for strength and lightness.
    Covering: Thick outer layer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) + soft silicone rubber mix.
    Protective Layer: Non-conductive, IR-transparent coating (polycarbonate/TPU blend).
    Durability: High impact resistance, flexible and comfortable, snap-fit hinge system for breakaway protection.

C. Does the thermal lens view make your eyes feel sensitive?

    Risk: Prolonged exposure to bright IR/thermal images can cause eye strain or discomfort.
    Solution: Auto-dimming logic, mild color palette, and perimeter-only highlighting reduce intensity.
    Upgrade: Eye-sensitive lens tech (electrochromic or liquid crystal layer) auto-adjusts brightness and contrast based on ambient light and user focus, preventing retina overload.

D. How is thermal imaging optimized for eye health?

    Lens Logic: Smart chip processes IR readings, displays silhouettes/outlines with minimal brightness, only enough detail for situational awareness.
    Focus: Adaptive highlighting and perimeter drawing. Breath, eye heat, and body heat shown in subtle overlays.
    Language: Embedded firmware in C/C++ (for speed), with Python microservices for image logic. Real-time machine vision library (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite).
