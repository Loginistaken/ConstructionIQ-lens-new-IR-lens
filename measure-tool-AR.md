🧠 HOW TO BUILD THIS SYSTEM

🕶️ 1. Sunglass Frame & Lens Material

    Frame:

        Material: Titanium alloy (lightweight + durable) with embedded PCB (Printed Circuit Board).

        Properties: Withstand heat, water, and job-site impacts.

    Lens:

        Material: Electrochromic polymer-based transparent OLED or MicroLED display

        Function: Allows transparent vision that turns into a digital display when activated.

💾 2. Embedded Microchip (On-Device AI Processor)

    Candidate chip:

        Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 (used in AR/VR glasses, handles computer vision, edge AI)

        Alternative: Apple R1 (if Apple architecture is adopted)

    Key Features:

        Low power consumption

        Real-time computer vision

        Edge computing: No internet/cloud needed

🧠 3. Sensor System
Sensor Type	Purpose
Eye-tracking sensor (IR-based)	Detect fixation & trigger measurement
Stereo depth cameras	Estimate object distance in ft/in
IMU (gyro + accelerometer)	Detect head orientation
LIDAR module (optional)	Precision in indoor/outdoor depth sensing

📐 4. Real-Time Object Measurement

    Approach: Use SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with stereo vision and/or LIDAR

    Software: OpenCV + custom geometric libraries

    AR overlay: Measurements rendered in augmented layers on the lens

📁 5. LensClick System: Manual + Tool Suggestions

    Button control: Capacitive touch or physical scroll-wheel on frame

    Manuals loaded: Stored locally in compressed format (.PDF/.HTML5/.SVG)

    Object recognition: AI model trained on construction tools/parts

    Query mapping:

        “What saw?” → Lookup object size, suggest correct saw

        “What screw size?” → Lookup prior LensClicks, match drill/screw requirements

🔧 6. Programming Stack
Component	Language
Main software	C++ (performance-critical vision, embedded)
AR & GUI overlays	Unity or Unreal Engine (C#/Blueprints or C++)
Object recognition	Python (training), TensorFlow Lite (on-chip inference)
Sensor integration	C/C++ + OpenCV + custom geometry engine
Eye tracking	C/C++ + open-source libs (e.g., OpenGaze, Tobii SDK)
Memory/database	SQLite (lightweight, local) or Flatbuffers

📦 7. Data Storage Estimate

Let’s estimate based on a modular micro-SD/embedded flash:

    Object models: ~1000 items (20–50KB each): ~50MB

    Instruction PDFs (compressed): ~100 files (500KB each): ~50MB

    Logs + Measurement history: ~10MB

    Image references: ~50MB (compressed)

Total Estimated Storage: 128MB – 256MB (very manageable for embedded systems)
RAM Required: Minimum 2GB for smooth AI + AR rendering
Expandable Storage: MicroSD slot (optional)

🔋 8. Power Management

    Battery: Flexible lithium-polymer in the arms of glasses

    Power optimization:

        Use eye-tracking as trigger instead of always-on processing

        AI edge chip with ultra-low power mode

        Sleep/wake logic tied to movement sensors

📷 INTERACTION FLOW EXAMPLE

    🔧 Worker puts on glasses → sees a pipe → stares at it for 3 sec →
    AR layer appears:

        Distance: 12.5 ft

        Diameter: 6 in

        Material: Steel

        Manual: [View]

        Suggested tools: Pipe wrench (14"), Gloves, Welding torch

        Saved Reference: Pipe X from Zone A — Match angle 62.1°
