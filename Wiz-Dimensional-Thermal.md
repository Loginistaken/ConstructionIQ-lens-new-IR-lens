Introducing the Wiz-Dimensional Thermal IR Lens: The Future of Smart Vision

The Wiz-Dimensional Thermal IR Lens redefines smart eyewear, bringing real-time material 
recognition, bio-sensing, and adaptive vision to the construction and industrial workspace. 
Inspired by visionary inventors, this game-changing device puts the power of advanced sensing 
and AI directly on the user’s face, transforming how professionals interact with their environment.

Innovative Dual Battery & Dual Chip Design
Engineered for reliability, Wiz-Bit features a breakthrough dual battery system, 
delivering up to 26 hours of continuous operation. Nano lithium cells are encased 
in a non-shock, scratch-proof metal core, separated by a multi-layer protective coating
that insulates against impact and bio-hazards. The dual-chip architecture integrates 
a high-speed AI logic chip with an IR conversion processor, instantly translating 
infrared signals into visible silhouette contours—at light-speed—using a custom firmware coded in C++ and Python. 
This ensures seamless logic transfer between chips for instant analysis and display.

Adaptive Vision: Night & Day Functionality
Wiz-Bit is as versatile as it is powerful. In normal mode, it functions as premium sunglasses 
with a soft-touch, ergonomic frame and multi-layer lens stack (including anti-scratch, anti-glare,
and bio-hazard resistant coatings). A single touch activates the day or night IR modes:

    Daylight Mode: The lens displays a subtle glowing perimeter around heat-emitting objects, 
    using a gentle overlay to highlight body heat and material signatures without overwhelming the user’s vision.
    Night Vision Mode: The lens transitions to a clear, focused view, with breath and eye sensors 
    that sharpen heat signatures and glowing eyes. The sensitive lens balances IR intensity, 
    ensuring users are never blinded, even in complete darkness.

Intelligent Sensors & Auto-Adjustment

Integrated breath and eye sensors analyze real-time biometric feedback, while motion sensors
automatically switch between heat and silhouette modes as the user moves. The glasses adapt instantly,
providing a glowing perimeter around objects and people in thermal IR silhouette, boosting safety and awareness.

Bio-Hazard Protection & Comfort

Every Wiz-Bit lens is coated with a proprietary bio-hazard protection layer, 
safeguarding users from airborne contaminants. The metal core structure offers 
durability and shock resistance, while the soft-touch outer frame ensures all-day comfort—even in demanding environments.

On-Off & Mode Switching

The device is simple to operate. Use as regular sunglasses in the off position;
activate thermal IR by touch to unlock advanced vision. Switch between day and night modes, or let the auto-sensor handle transitions.

Material Layers & Lens Construction

Wiz-Bit lenses are constructed from a composite of scratch-proof, anti-glare, IR-transmissive polymers, 
layered with bio-hazard protection and a soft-touch finish that’s gentle on the eyes. Each component is 
designed to maximize comfort, clarity, and durability.

Estimated Cost & Recommendations

    Estimated Cost: $480 per unit, including batteries, chips, coatings, and smart sensors.
    Battery Life: Up to 26 hours continuous, dual-battery system.
    Chipset: AI logic + IR processor (custom, upgradable).
    Code Language: Primarily C++ for hardware logic, Python for AI pattern recognition.

Additional Recommendations:

    Optional prescription lens integration.
    Wireless charging pad accessory.
    Modular chip upgrade support for future features.

Wiz-Bit Thermal IR Lens isn’t just eyewear—it’s a smart, adaptable, 
and protective vision platform for the next generation of workers and innovators.
The concept is on the table: we invite inspired minds to join in elevating this breakthrough to reality

1. Questions & Answers
A. How long do they run and what’s the battery made of? Is it in the frame?

    Battery Type: Lithium Polymer (LiPo) or advanced solid-state microbattery.
    Placement: Two slim batteries, one in each arm of the frame, close to the hinge (temple area).
    Single Battery Life: ~4-6 hours continuous thermal mode; ~10+ hours regular mode.
    Dual System: ~8-12 hours thermal mode (both batteries active).
    Charge Time: ~1-1.5 hours (fast USB-C charging per side).
    Biohazard Safety: Batteries are sealed, low-heat emission, and encased in non-conductive, heat-resistant material.

B. What’s the frame made of (element-wise)? Is it durable?

    Core: Aircraft-grade titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, elements: Ti, Al, V) for strength and lightness.
    Covering: Thick outer layer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) + soft silicone rubber mix.
    Protective Layer: Non-conductive, IR-transparent coating (polycarbonate/TPU blend).
    Durability: High impact resistance, flexible and comfortable, snap-fit hinge system for breakaway protection.

C. Does the thermal lens view make your eyes feel sensitive?

    Risk: Prolonged exposure to bright IR/thermal images can cause eye strain or discomfort.
    Solution: Auto-dimming logic, mild color palette, and perimeter-only highlighting reduce intensity.
    Upgrade: Eye-sensitive lens tech (electrochromic or liquid crystal layer) auto-adjusts brightness 
    and contrast based on ambient light and user focus, preventing retina overload.

D. How is thermal imaging optimized for eye health?

    Lens Logic: Smart chip processes IR readings, displays silhouettes/outlines with minimal brightness,
    only enough detail for situational awareness.
    Focus: Adaptive highlighting and perimeter drawing. Breath, eye heat, and body heat shown in subtle overlays.
    Language: Embedded firmware in C/C++ (for speed), with Python microservices for image logic. 
    Real-time machine vision library (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite).
